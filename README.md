# About ShiftHappens
ShiftHappens is a concept project that was created by a couple of students for their exam in Software Programming, taken in their second semester of the Software Engineering program offered by UiA Grimstad, Norway.
The goal was to create a project using C++ based on very clear functional requirements given (which can be read here: https://bit.ly/ShiftHappens-functional-requirements).

## Reflections
This was our first group project at UiA. Using Git as a version control system, getting used to using new tools (such as Qt) were challenging but fun. In hindsight, we would aim for better file structuring and a clearer architecture.
